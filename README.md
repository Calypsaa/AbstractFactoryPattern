### AbstractFactoryPattern

In this study, I tried to code one of the creative patterns, ***Abstract Factory***.
The Abstract Factory pattern is a design pattern that we can use in situations where we want to operate with multiple objects at the same time.

While there is a single interface belonging to a single product family in the ***Factory*** design pattern, there are different interfaces for different product families in the ***abstract factory***.

If we think of it as a factory, the Factory design pattern is the factory where only one product is produced, and the Abstract Factory design pattern is the production of different products.
We can think of it as the factory where it is produced.

***When to Use Abstract Factory?***

When we have to work with more than one product family, it is used to abstract the product family and the client side.

By separating the formation of product families by the client, it enables us to set up a flexible and expandable structure without making a decision.
